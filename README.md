`lumper` is an experimental Virtual Machine Manager written in Rust. The project aims to provide a performant, intuitive CLI allowing users to run & manage a virtual machine.

**Project is experimental and should not be used in any production systems.**

## Quick start (without Docker)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a compiled linux kernel with a initramfs configured before you start.

If you don't have one, follow these steps :

- Make a basic rootfs :

```bash
./rootfs/mkrootfs.sh
```

- Build a linux kernel :

```bash
./kernel/mkkernel.sh
```

Press enter when `Built-in initramfs compression mode` is asked.

### Build

```bash
cd lumper
cargo build --release
```

### Run

```bash
./target/release/lumper --kernel <your_kernel_path>/arch/x86/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin
```

You should see this in your console :

```bash
/ #
```

To see all the available arguments :

```bash
./target/release/lumper --help
```

## Quick start (with Docker)
If you have `docker` installed you can use the Dockerfile directly.
```bash
docker build -t lumper .
docker run --device=/dev/kvm -it lumper bash
```
Then you can launch a sample VM:
```bash
./target/release/lumper --kernel linux-cloud-hypervisor/vmlinux --initramfs initramfs.img
```
